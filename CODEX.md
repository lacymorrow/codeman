# CODEX - AI-Powered Code Repository Browser

CODEX is a brutalist-style GitHub repository browser that integrates with CodeSandbox Devboxes to provide a terminal/console environment for any GitHub repository.

## Features

- Clean, brutalist UI design
- Load any public GitHub repository
- Browse repository file structure
- View files in CodeSandbox Devbox environment
- Full terminal/console access
- AI code editing capabilities (in progress)

## Why CodeSandbox Devboxes?

CodeSandbox Devboxes provide several advantages over traditional sandboxes:

1. **Full VM Capabilities**: Run any command, install any dependency
2. **Terminal Access**: Interact directly with the codebase via command line
3. **Speed**: MicroVMs start in seconds
4. **Memory Snapshots**: Save and restore environments quickly
5. **Persistent Development**: Continue working where you left off

## Getting Started

See detailed setup instructions in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md).

## The Future of CODEX

This application aims to become a full AI code editor that can:

1. Load a GitHub repository
2. Allow AI-powered code editing
3. Provide terminal access for running commands
4. Avoid the complexity of traditional IDEs and CLIs
